Take any Dataset of your choice ,perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and apply a suitable Classifier,Regressor or Clusterer and calculate the accuracy of the model.
<p>Completed exploratory data analysis after normalising the data. </p>
<p> Since the dataset was too small, I enlarged the dataset to improve the accuracy.</p>
<p>I reshaped the x and y values since they were 1d arrays otherwise</p>
<p> I used random forest classfier, random forest regressor and SVM models.</p>
<p>The accuracies I got in each case were 80.0, 76.92917188805347 and 80.0 </p>
